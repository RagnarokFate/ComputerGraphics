## Description :
This repository presents gaming engine with different properties. it is a first perspective 3d world projection present Mesh Model/Camera/Post processing/Lighting & Shading.

This project consists of three different folders each previews Gemoerty Computations.

### Folder #1 - Computer-Graphics-version1-C++
In this folder,I've implemented these procedures:
1. Mesh Model display via Bresenham Algorithim.
2. Mesh Model Transformation (in terms of Local/World implementation).
3. Camera Transformation + Camera Projection + LookAt Matrix.
4. FaceCulling + Subdivision + Mesh Model Axis + Mesh Model Physical Vertex/Face Normal Draw.

### Folder #2 - Computer-Graphics-version1-C++
In this folder,I've implemented these procedures:
1. Mesh Model Depth Calculation which operated in each face indiviually and stored in Z-buffer (an array of size Height x Width x 3(RGB)).
2. Mesh Model Face Full paint.
3. Lighting & Shading
4. Post processing (Fug and Gaussian Blur)

### Folder #3 - Computer-Graphics-version1-C++
Lastly, we converted the whole C++ Project into OpenGL implementation through shaders that runs in GPU.
1. Mesh Model display 
2. Mesh Model Transformation
3. Phong Shade Coloring
4. Texture + Texture Mapping
5. Enviroment Mapping + Normal Mapping + Toon Shading.
